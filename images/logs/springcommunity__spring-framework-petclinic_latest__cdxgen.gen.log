EXIT_CODE: 0

==== STDOUT ====
/bin/sh: 1: mvn: not found

The above build errors could be due to:

1. Java version requirement: cdxgen container image bundles Java 24 with maven 3.9 which might be incompatible. Try running cdxgen with the custom JDK11-based image `ghcr.io/cyclonedx/cdxgen-java11:v11`.
2. Private dependencies cannot be downloaded: Check if any additional arguments must be passed to maven and set them via MVN_ARGS environment variable.
3. Check if all required environment variables including any maven profile arguments are passed correctly to this tool.

Falling back to parsing pom.xml files. Only direct dependencies would get included!


==== STDERR ====
Multiple errors occurred while building this project with maven. The SBOM is therefore incomplete!
