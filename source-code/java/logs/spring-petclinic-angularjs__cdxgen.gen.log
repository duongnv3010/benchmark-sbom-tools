1. Try building the project with 'mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true' using the correct version of Java and maven before invoking cdxgen.
2. Private dependencies cannot be downloaded: Check if any additional arguments must be passed to maven and set them via MVN_ARGS environment variable.
3. Check if all required environment variables including any maven profile arguments are passed correctly to this tool.

Falling back to parsing pom.xml files. Only direct dependencies would get included!


==== STDERR ====
Multiple errors occurred while building this project with maven. The SBOM is therefore incomplete!
