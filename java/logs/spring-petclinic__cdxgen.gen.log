==== STDOUT ====
*** GRADLE BUILD ERRORS ***
1. Check if the correct version of java and gradle are installed and available in PATH. For example, some project might require Java 11 with gradle 7.
 cdxgen container image bundles Java 23 with gradle 8 which might be incompatible.
2. Try running cdxgen with the custom JDK11-based image `ghcr.io/cyclonedx/cdxgen-java11:v11`.
